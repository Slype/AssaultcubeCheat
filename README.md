# AssaultcubeCheat written in C#

External cheat created for educational purposes only.

It comes with:
- Godmode (Infinite health)
- Infinite Ammo
- Ability to find nearest enemy
- Aimbot on firing
- Aimbot on scoping
- Continuous aimbot
- Auto jump while crouched

It uses my own custom made class for reading memory addresses.

It has only been used against computer controlled bots.

I do not support cheating against other players.

I do however find it of much interest to understand how one goes about to manipulate another process.
